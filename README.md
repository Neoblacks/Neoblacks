# Hello world üññ

Currently a student at Ecole 42 since November 2022, I've had the opportunity to develop my skills through various common core projects.
In parallel with my studies, I also worked on a personal project with a colleague using the school's API, which met a great success with students and staff alike : [Friends42](https://github.com/wow0000/friends42)

Used by over **4,200 unique users**, with an average of **2,000 visits per day**, **Friends42** has become **one of the most widely used tools at Ecole 42.** This experience has enabled me to learn new skills in a real-life context, and to optimize the user experience on a large scale.

Here's an overview of the three common core projects I'm particularly proud of :
